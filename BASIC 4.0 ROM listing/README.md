# BASIC 4.0 ROM listing
<img src="https://github.com/Audioniek/Commodore/blob/main/BASIC 4.0 ROM listing/pictures/basic4.03_001.png"/>

Back in the good old days (beginning of 1984) I made a ROM listing for CBM's BASIC 4.0.

Here it is in its original publised form as a PDF, with some comments added at the end.

While perusing this, please bear in mind that the listing was made when the original source code was unavailable; it is still one of the most detailed ROM listings around.

The majority of the text is in fact the listing output of Carl Moser's MAE assembler.
